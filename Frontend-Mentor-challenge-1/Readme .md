### What I learned

This was my first real project after learning html and css basics.

I learnt a great deal from this exeprience.

The major points i learnt were with regards to the HTML Semantics and CSS units

Some Key points that i learnt are as folows:

a. Different Css units for Different elements and Wrapers:
    1 Responsive Font unit = vw
    2 Responsive Margin unit = percentage
    3 responsive Padding unit = em

b. HTML Semantic:
    1 Using specific semantic wrapers for specific tasks for clarity of structure.

c. How media query works

d. Hidding elements in normal html syntax {using visibility:hidden and width,height value zero} than using them inn media query.




### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
